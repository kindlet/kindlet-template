# Kindlet Template
## A simple template for creating Kindlets

## Important Notices

* You'll need the Java 8 JDK. I initially was using the Java 17 JDK and it gave an error.
* **DO NOT** change the build target!!! This will mess up the build!

## Useful Resources

Almost all of these come from the [MobileRead Forums](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/) or the MobileRead Wiki. If you're going to make a Kindlet, I highly recommend signing up for the MobileRead forum as it is essentially the only place you'll be able to get help making your Kindlet these days.
